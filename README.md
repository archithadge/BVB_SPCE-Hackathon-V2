### BVB_SPCE-Hackathon-V2

IGovern is a universal communication platform between government and the citizens
The government doesnâ€™t have any medium to know what does the public thinks about the reforms that they are planning to bring.
Indian citizens need a system to raise their issues or present their demands in front of the government.
To get the benefit of government schemes citizens have to create accounts on the website of that scheme. They need to authenticate themselves and upload documents. If someone wants to take benefit of multiple schemes then that person has to perform this repetitive task multiple times. A centralized platform is needed where citizens can create accounts and use the same account for applying on every scheme they want.
